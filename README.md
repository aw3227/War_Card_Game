# War_Card_Game

C# Command Line Card Game Modeled After the Game War

By Andrew Williams

### Description:

This game was created with Visual Studio 2017 on a Windows computer and has not been tested on Visual Studio for Mac or Linux.

The game is intended to be played by 2 users and allows the users to simulate any number of turns/battles they choose until someone wins.
This mechanism is important because the game involves no strategy and can sometimes take thousands of turns for a winner to be identified.
Once a game is completed the users will be asked if they would like to play again. This mechanism allows users to simulate playing multiple 
games quickly if they want to see who would win a certain number of games first.

### Unittests:

Additionally, the War_Card_GameTests directory contains some simple unittests for the Card and War classes. These were created to
learn more about how unittesting in Visual Studio compares to Java and Python Unittesting. They should not be considered examples of 
high quality C# unittests.
